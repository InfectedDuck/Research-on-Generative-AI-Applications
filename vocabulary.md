# Generative AI Vocabulary 

1. LLM (Large Language Model)
   - A computer program that learns patterns in lots of text and can write or continue sentences.

2. Tokenization
   - The way text is broken into small pieces (words or parts of words) so the model can read them.

3. Fine-tuning
   - Extra training on a model using a smaller, specific set of examples so it gets better at one job.

4. Prompt
   - The instruction or question you give the model to tell it what you want it to do.

5. Hallucination
   - When the model makes up information that is not true or not based on facts.

6. Retrieval
   - Finding documents or pieces of text from a collection and giving them to the model to help it answer.

7. Embedding
   - A way to turn words or sentences into numbers so a computer can compare their meaning.

8. Few-shot / Zero-shot
   - Few-shot: showing the model a few examples in the instruction. Zero-shot: asking the model without giving examples.

9. Multimodal
   - A system that can work with more than one kind of data, like text and images together.

10. Diffusion model
    - A type of model that makes images by improving noisy pictures until they look real.

11. Inference
    - Using the trained model to get answers or create text from new inputs.

12. Data provenance
    - Keeping track of where data came from so we know if it can be trusted.

13. Grounding
    - Giving the model real information to base its answers on so it is less likely to make things up.

14. Vector search
    - A way to find texts with similar meaning using their numeric form.

15. Privacy / Safety
    - Thinking about user data and avoiding harmful or private content when building systems.
